I've made some modifications.

Run this script on a folder of raw files and it will create two folders - raw and jpeg - and put the raw files in /raw, and create jpegs from the raw files and stick them in /raw.

Requirements:
convert from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
dcraw from http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/
exiftool from http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
Python (I'm using 2.6 right now, haven't tested on other versions)
